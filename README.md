# cyberia

This is a simple abstraction of <a href="https://github.com/valyala/fasthttp"></a> to simplify api development. 

Cyberia has been inspired by Fiber, a library inspired by Express that runs on fasthttp aswell.

This library uses <a href="https://github.com/bytedance/sonic">sonic</a>, a fast json library for Go, implemented in Assembly, but you can change it to any other library that you want.
